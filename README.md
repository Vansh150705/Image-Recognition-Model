# Image Recognition System

**Basic Image Recognition Model using Python**

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a **basic image recognition system** built in **Python** on **Google Colab**.  
It uses a **Kaggle dataset** to classify images and demonstrates understanding of **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**.  

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Platform:** Google Colab  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, if you used it)  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle image dataset  

---

## ⚡ Features

- Preprocesses images for model training  
- Builds a neural network for image classification  
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy metrics  
- Visualizes predictions with sample images  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the dataset from Kaggle or mount Google Drive.  
3. Run all cells to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.  

> ⚠️ This is a basic implementation meant to demonstrate practical ML workflow.
